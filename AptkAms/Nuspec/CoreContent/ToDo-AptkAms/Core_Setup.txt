1. Update/Create your Model classes so that they all inherit from EntityData abstract class 
or ITableData interface if there's another parent class yet.

2. Install this package on your platform(s) project(s) to configure and initialize the plugin before using it

3. (Optional) Registering an intance of this plugin with IoC is a better way to use it than calling the static AptkAmsPluginLoader.Instance each time
(Look at MvvmCross, MvvmLight, FreshMvvm or any Mvvm/IoC framework of your choice).


/!\ 1: If your Model classes are not hosted by this project, you also need to install this nuget package into it (see online documentation and tutorials)

/!\ 2: If you want to manage local data thanks to LocalTable<T> and Push methods
you have to install the nuget package AptkAmsLocalStore aka Azure Mobile Services Plugin Local Store Extension for Xamarin and Windows

/!\ 3: If you plan to use the custom login/password LoginAsync and RegistrationAsync method (also true for the EnsureLoggedInAsync one when controlToken is set to true),
you have to create EmailLogin, EmailRegistration and ControlToken custom api controllers on your backend (see online documentation and tutorials)


Enjoy!
