1. Add these lines right before e.PreviousExecutionState == ApplicationExecutionState.Terminated into the App OnLaunched method and complete it:

        var configuration = new AptkAmsPluginConfiguration("YOUR URL", "YOUR KEY", typeof("ONE OF YOUR MODEL CLASS").GetTypeInfo().Assembly);
        AptkAmsPluginLoader.Init(configuration);

2. (Optional) Registering an intance of this plugin with IoC is a better way to use it than calling the static AptkAmsPluginLoader.Instance each time.
Please look at MvvmCross, MvvmLight, FreshMvvm or any Mvvm/IoC framework of your choice and see online documentation and tutorials

3. (Optional) There are many other optional settings to configure (like credentials caching, expired token auto handling, etc...) so please refer to online documentation and tutorials


Enjoy!


/!\ 1: If you want to manage local data thanks to LocalTable<T> and Push methods
you have to install the nuget package AptkAmsLocalStore aka Azure Mobile Services Plugin Local Store Extension for Xamarin and Windows
